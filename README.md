# 🎨 BasePlace - Collaborative Canvas on Farcaster

BasePlace is a collaborative pixel art canvas mini app for Farcaster, inspired by r/place. Every 6 hours, the canvas resets and the final artwork is minted as an NFT on Base network.

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) + TypeScript + React app built with the Farcaster Mini Apps SDK.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Collaborative Canvas**: 100x100 pixel grid where users can place pixels
- ⏱️ **6-Hour Sessions**: Canvas resets every 6 hours
- 🖼️ **NFT Minting**: Each completed canvas is automatically minted as an NFT
- 🎨 **16-Color Palette**: r/place inspired color selection
- ⏳ **Cooldown System**: 30-second cooldown between pixel placements
- 🔄 **Real-time Updates**: See pixels appear in real-time using Supabase
- 📱 **Mobile-First**: Optimized for Farcaster mobile apps
- 🔍 **Zoom & Pan**: Navigate the canvas easily
- 🖼️ **NFT Gallery**: View all previously minted canvases

## 📖 Guide

Check out [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions and architecture overview.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase Database

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://jzgwenebmxxpapvtvhwa.supabase.co
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL script from `supabase-schema.sql`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file (see SETUP.md for details):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-app-url.vercel.app
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your-neynar-api-key
NEYNAR_CLIENT_ID=your-neynar-client-id
```

### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to the local development URL.

### Importing the CLI
To invoke the CLI directly in JavaScript, add the npm package to your project and use the following import statement:
```{javascript}
import { init } from '@neynar/create-farcaster-mini-app';
```

## Deploying to Vercel
For projects that have made minimal changes to the quickstart template, deploy to vercel by running:
```{bash}
npm run deploy:vercel
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:
```{bash}
npm run build
```

The above command will generate a `.env` file based on the `.env.local` file and user input. Be sure to configure those environment variables on your hosting platform.

## Developing Script Locally

This section is only for working on the script and template. If you simply want to create a mini app and _use_ the template, this section is not for you.

### Recommended: Using `npm link` for Local Development

To iterate on the CLI and test changes in a generated app without publishing to npm:

1. In your installer/template repo (this repo), run:
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```
   This makes your local version globally available as a symlinked package.


1. Now, when you run:
   ```bash
   npx @neynar/create-farcaster-mini-app
   ```
   ...it will use your local changes (including any edits to `init.js` or other files) instead of the published npm version.

### Alternative: Running the Script Directly

You can also run the script directly for quick iteration:

```bash
node ./bin/index.js
```

However, this does not fully replicate the npx install flow and may not catch all issues that would occur in a real user environment.

### Environment Variables and Scripts

If you update environment variable handling, remember to replicate any changes in the `dev`, `build`, and `deploy` scripts as needed. The `build` and `deploy` scripts may need further updates and are less critical for most development workflows.
